# womenHackTheBias - ShesWithUs

ShesWithUs is a project created for the 2022 All Women Virtual Hackathon:  Women Hack The Bias

Our team of six worked to develop the design for an inclusive online space where women from all walks of life could come together to share their experiences, seek advice, and support one another.

My task was to take the wireframes and mocks prepared by the design team and build them out into a clickable prototype.

For best results, the project should be viewed on a mobile device or in your browser's responsive design mode; the desktop version is still a work in progress.
